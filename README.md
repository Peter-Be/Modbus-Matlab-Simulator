# Modbus-Matlab-Simulator
A Matlab/Simulink library that allows basic Modbus/TCP read and write operations.

This library is part of a Matlab-based simulation environment that generates Modbus/TCP traffic between  a SCADA system and a PLC system. 
The process for the SCADA and the PLC can be simulated by using standard Matlab/Simulink functionalities as shown in the examples.
